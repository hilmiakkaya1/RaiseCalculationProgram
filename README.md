# Raise Calculation Program 

This Ruby program is used to calculate the salary after a raise by entering the user's salary and raise percentage.

## How it works

1. Run the program (for example, `ruby raise_calculation.rb`).
2. First, the program will ask you to enter your salary. Please enter a valid salary. If you enter an invalid salary, the program will give you an error message and ask you to try again until you enter a valid salary.

3. Next, the program will ask you to enter the raise percentage. For example, if you want to give a 30% raise, enter 30. Again, remember that you only need to enter numbers. If you enter an invalid number, the program will give you an error message and ask you to try again until you enter a valid number.

4. Once you have entered the correct salary and raise percentage, the program will calculate the raise amount and the salary after the raise.

5. The program will show the results to the user. The program will display the raise amount and salary after the raise on the screen.

## Example Use

```
Please enter your salary
25000
Please enter the percentage increase (for example, if 30%, enter 30)
30
Amount of increase 7500 TL
Your salary after the raise: 32500 TL
```

## Error Checks

- When a valid salary or raise percentage is not entered, the program will give appropriate error messages.
- Since only numbers are allowed to be entered, incorrect entries with text or symbols are prevented.

This program will help you easily calculate your salary after a raise by entering your salary and raise percentage. Have a good use!
